C++ alternative to [defer](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Defer_statements) operator in [go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language)).

A "DEFER" statement invokes a function whose execution is deferred to the moment the surrounding function returns, either because the surrounding function executed a return statement, reached the end of its function body, or because the exception was thrown.

## Features

* Simple syntax
* C++11
* Header-only
* Dependency-free

## [Example](example/example.cpp) & Key Use Cases

* File close

```cpp
std::ofstream file("test.txt");
DEFER{ file.close(); }; // File close when the enclosing scope exits or an error is thrown.
```

* Delete dynamic array

```cpp
int* dynamic_array = new int[10];
DEFER{ delete[] dynamic_array; }; // Array delete when the enclosing scope exits or an error is thrown.
```

* Custom defer

```cpp
persons.push_back(person); // Add the person to db.
MAKE_DEFER(custom_defer){ // Following block is executed when the enclosing scope exits or an error is thrown.
  persons.pop_back(); // If the db insertion that follows fails, we should rollback.
};
// ...
custom_defer.Dismiss(); // An exception was not thrown, so don't execute the defer.
```

## Integration

You need to add the single required file [scope_guard.hpp](include/scope_guard.hpp), and the necessary switches to enable C++11.

## Compiler compatibility

* GCC
* Clang
* MSVC
